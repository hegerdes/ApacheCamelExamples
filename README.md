# Example usage of Apache Camel

This repro contains two examples for Apache Camel. It was created for demo usage in a university course.

## Example 1 FTP-Watch

This minimal example creates a FileWatcher for a (S)FTP Server and creates local copies. No knowledge about FTP required.

## Example 2 Twitter-Search-Feed

This example connects to the native Twitter-API and pulls tweets wich the selected search words. These tweets get converted to a German date format and pushes the tweets to a local WebSocket. Additionally all tweets are logged to the drive.
